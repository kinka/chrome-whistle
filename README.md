Whistle
=======

Whistle is a chrome extension redirecting online static resources to local files. Using RegExp patterns, mapping the whole directory to local folder workspace. We can edit sources in the Sources panel and save them directly to mapping workspace, no need to worry about missing when pages refreshed. However, we also need a proxy server transferring local files. So, I have another project named __whistle-proxy__, acting as a http proxy webserver.
